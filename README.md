CivicEcho – AI-Driven Public Transport Complaint Hub

CivicEcho is a research-oriented AI-based system designed to modernize the complaint handling mechanism of public transportation services such as RTC buses, Metro, and MMTS.

The system processes unstructured passenger complaints in the form of text, images, and videos, and applies Big Data Analytics, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically:
i)Classify complaint types
ii)Estimate severity levels
iii)Cluster similar complaints
iv)Prioritize high-impact issues
v)Generate summarized reports for decision support

CivicEcho transforms raw passenger feedback into structured, actionable insights that help transport authorities improve service quality, enhance transparency, and reduce resolution time.

Key Features: 
i)Multi-modal complaint submission (Text, Image, Video)
ii)AI-based issue classification
iii)Clustering using advanced algorithms (HDBSCAN / K-Means)
iv)LLM-powered complaint summarization
v)Real-time complaint status tracking
vi)Admin analytics dashboard

Technologies Used:

i)MERN Stack
ii)Deep Learning (Transformers, CNN)
iii)LLM Integration
iv)Big Data Processing
v) Cloudinary

Status:

Currently under development (Research & Implementation Phase)
